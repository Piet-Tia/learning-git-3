			<h1>Resurrection</h1>
			<h2>Fear Factory</h2>
			<p>Consumed with memories that preceded today
			Given a chance to bereave life thats slipping away
			Suffered through tragedy of my slow decay
			Deceptive tendencies dragged my soul away
			All that I know there was no God for me
			Force that shatters all, absence of mortality</p>
			
			<p>Revive all my fears
			Revive wasted tears
			Revive void within
			Revive once again...<p>
			
			<p>Forsaken by destiny, forsaken by my own mind
I must remove my skin to see belief in your eyes
All that I know there was no God for me
Force that shatters all, absence of humanity</p>
